README file for A.I.S.H.A

A.I.S.H.A (Artificial Intelligence Safety Home Assistant) is a final year student made Artificial intelligence product, designed to help all family members keep track of day to day activities and the location of people in the household. The system runs of technologically advanced software and hardware, items such as the Matrix Voice which allows the users to interact orally with the product. This is the product that allows quick and easy access to information through the software created by the students. It has a unique self made avatar system, which includes avatars which all the family can use it is family friendly and easy to use. We wanted to create a product which can give families a new way to keep safe, and a new way to experience technology. A.I.S.H.A’s job is to answer questions promoted by family members and then follow them up with an indication on where the current family member currently is, this is using the self made icons which include work, shopping, school and even walking the dog. We wanted to take inspiration from other AI systems and incorporate our ideas into the product to make it unique and add some creativity which other systems may not have. We wanted to create something that would be helpful and would fit into any home, something which people would enjoy using I feel that this is what we achieved. 

Our research started with looking at designs of exiting A.I Voice Systems and how we can improve on products which are already dominating the market. This includes us looking at Amazons Range, Googles Range, and other brands such as Apple, Lenovo, Bose, JBL, Sonos and others. We noticed they had a similar colour scheme and similar materials where used in production of the products, also the shape of the products they all seemed to use curved edges. We then looked into the price of products it looked as though there was a more affordable, middle of the range and high end product with both Amazon and Googles ranges and then there other brands filled up the gaps with het most affordable being either the “Amazon Echo Dot” or the "Google Home Mini,” and the most expensive being the "Google Home Max” at £399.  Then because of our location feature we looked at a product called “Tile” which is a tracking/location device that works by using (BLE)Bluetooth Low Energy connected to your phone and the app functions on both Apple and android devices. It allows you to keep track of anything you place the tile on with just your phone. Each device has a set range limit the highest being the pro version which is 300ft/90m, the costs range from £20-£30 depending on what version you purchase.

Following our product research we wanted to know what people wanted from an A.I system and when talking to people a lot of people wanted an aspect that was personal to them, something that they could look after and control, “it would be cool to have a small keyring or chip type of piece that worked with a system and stored data on it, it would make me feel safer”Anonymous. This is why we looked into creating an RFID feature that would work alongside the main product, RFID can be used in many ways but most commonly it is used for the safety of Credit/Debit cards.


The research was completed first for all aspects off the project so that we could gather a lot of inspiration and information and create something which we were happy with. It was helpful to split the research evenly and work on a presentation format which we could all access and add to when necessary. It turned out to be a very successful method.

We moved onto the graphics next so we could work on the way that the product was going to be finalised and presented we went for a very basic font for the logo, and Highlighted the letters “A” and “I” so the Artificial Intelligence aspect would stand out. We used colours which were common in the industry, these included, Black, Blue and grey.

The Icons were next and we wanted to create them so that they would be relatable for all ages so it was good to create simple but fun and colourful icons for the locations and for the avatars which we would use throughout the system, They were created though graphic software and exported at JPG files.

When working on the documentation for the project we wanted to explain every idea that we had so we created files for all aspects of the project, including, the icon ideas, tests, code, diagrams, exterior deigns and more. We also created a timeline and to do list to make sure we stay on track. Then we also added information from University Given documentation to help us with the project

We worked on paper a lot of the time to gather ideas and plan out what we wanted for the product this helped us to brainstorm and inspire us to work more on the project and possibly make it better. We found that a lot of our ideas came from paper source.

For the code we were originally going to use python and then we changed to javascript as we felt that we had more freedom and capability working on this platform and although it took a while to transfer the code over we feel that it was worth it in the long run and it has allowed us to play around with the product and create what we want.

For the exterior of the product we wanted to originally go for a similar shape to other A.I products but further into the development of the project we wanted to take a different angle so we went for a box which was accessible easily incase something went wrong with the product. We also thought about incorporating LED’s and making it a bit more aesthetically pleasing.

For the hardware we worked mainly with the “Matrix Voice” and a Raspberry Pi these were the two main factors for the project, we also used a display screen and have a camera installed, we also wanted to include RFID but didn’t know the best way to work it into the code and exterior shell of the product.


Overall we feel that the creativity of the product is good and that it shows originality that we steered away from the norm of A.I products and that we can be innovative with what we create. We feel that the code which was created is to the best of our ability and that it would of been better not to change it from one language to another so we should have chosen more wisely in the beginning but we feel it is organised and explained well. When it comes to the design of the product and its composition we feel that it has a pleasing aesthetic and reaches a good final result with the work which went into the exterior, and marketing of the product. The documentation could have been more organised but it does show that we analysed the work which we were creating and made sure we took note of everything which lead to the final result. With the engagement of the product we feel that we worked well with class given advice and the homework to keep track of the product and its development.

With the development of the product we wanted to be able to keep on track with all aspects of the project we wanted to accomplish and be experimental with the creativity and show we can develop something which has good techniques when it come to code and also has good structure. Communication when it came to design we felt was important and it is original. The Documentation shows we can implement key values and mark out what they mean to us during development and also being able to focus in class and pick up important information and have a positive attitude to the project and follow instructions when it comes to homework based activities.

In conclusion we feel that this project was well thought out and has many good key features which make it stand out from other product which may be similar to it on the market. We feel that the product and project went well but we all noticed ways in which we can improve this runs through all aspects of the project from the code which was created to the design of the product and even the way which documentation was handled. The project we feel that we gained a lot from and took a lot away which will become useful in future projects, we have learnt a lot and it was fun to experience new technology, this includes the hardware and software which we used and learnt about. We believe that if developed further A.I.S.H.A could become a really innovative product with a lot of potential to hit a piece of the technology market that hasn’t been covered yet and that with work on all aspects it could look and work very well and become very advanced. The project was handled well by all members of the group and we believe that we were able to use all of our skills within this project to create what we have. The name A.I.S.H.A is something that we hope to see one day and it has been a good experience for us all.
